# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure my code or program is functional, I will make sure sure that the code I am using is the best use for the program i am creating. Also, i will make sure to test the code i am using to make sure it is not changeable and doing the job it is created to do. 

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
First you will need to make sure that everything that the user is asking for is outlined withing the software. To do this, tests can be added within the code to ensure when the action is performed, it accomplishes what it needs to accomplish. 

#How do I approach designing software?
When I approach desginging code, i make sure that i understand the needs of the client and what they are looking to get out of the program. Without doing that, then i cannot fully create a code i do not understand. I then design the code piece by piece, because if not, it become overwhelming to write entire code, then test to see if it is performing correctly.
